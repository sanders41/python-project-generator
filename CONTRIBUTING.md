# Contributing

## Where to start

Contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are
welcome.

The best place to start is to check the [issues](https://github.com/sanders41/python-project-generator/issues)
for something that interests you.

## Bug Reports

Please include:

1.  A short, self-contained snippet reproducing the problem. You can format the code by using
    [GitHub markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github). For
    example:

        ```sh
        python-project create
        ```

2.  Explain what is currently happening and what you expect instead.

## Working on the code

### Fork the project

In order to work on the project you will need your own fork. To do this click the "Fork" button on
this project.

Once the project is forked clone it to your local machine:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:your-user-name/python-project-generator
cd python-project-generator
git remote add upstream git@github.com:sanders41/python-project-generator
```

This creates the directory python-project-generator and connects your repository to the upstream (main project)
repository.

### Creating a branch

You want your main branch to reflect only production-ready code, so create a feature branch for
making your changes. For example:

```sh
git checkout -b my-new-feature
```

This changes your working directory to the my-new-feature branch. Keep any changes in this branch
specific to one bug or feature so the purpose is clear. You can have many my-new-features and switch
in between them using the git checkout command.

When creating this branch, make sure your main branch is up to date with the latest upstream
main version. To update your local main branch, you can do:

```sh
git checkout main
git pull upstream main --ff-only
```

### Code linting, formatting, and tests

#### Run linting

```sh
cargo clippy
```

To check with the FastAPI feature enabled

```sh
cargo clippy -F fastapi
```

#### Run the code formatter

```sh
cargo fmt --all
```

#### Testing the code

[insta](https://insta.rs") is used for snapshot testing. It is recommended
to install [cargo-insta](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/insta/tree/master/cargo-insta) to run the
tests

```sh
cargo install cargo-insta --locked
```

To run the tests:

```sh
cargo insta test
```

To run tests with the fastapi feature enabled

````sh
cargo insta test -F fastapi

If the code change is expected to update a snapshot, for example when updating a default
dependency, run the tests with the verify flat and check that the new snapshots are correct, then
accept them.

```sh
cargo insta test --verify
````

For the fastapi feature

```sh
cargo insta test --verify -F fastapi
```

#### Ensure the code compiles

```sh
cargo check
```

For the fastapi feature

```sh
cargo check -F fastapi
```

Be sure to run all these checks before submitting your pull request.

#### just

If you have [just](https://github.com/casey/just) installed it can be used for testing and linting.

To run linting:

```sh
just lint
```

To run tests:

```sh
just test-all
```

To run tests and review snapshots:

```sh
just test-review
```

To run tests with the FastAPI feature enabled and review snapshots:

```sh
just test-review-fastapi
```

To see a full list of `just` commands run `just --list`

## Committing your code

Once you have made changes to the code on your branch you can see which files have changed by running:

```sh
git status
```

If new files were created that and are not tracked by git they can be added by running:

```sh
git add .
```

Now you can commit your changes in your local repository:

```sh
git commit -am 'Some short helpful message to describe your changes'
```

## Push your changes

Once your changes are ready and all linting/tests are passing you can push your changes to your
forked repository:

```sh
git push origin my-new-feature
```

origin is the default name of your remote repository on GitHub. You can see all of your remote
repositories by running:

```sh
git remote -v
```

## Making a Pull Request

After pushing your code to origin it is now on GitHub but not yet part of the python-project-generator project.
When you’re ready to ask for a code review, file a pull request. Before you do, once again make sure
that you have followed all the guidelines outlined in this document regarding code style, tests, and
documentation. You should also double check your branch changes against the branch it was based on by:

1. Navigating to your repository on GitHub
1. Click on Branches
1. Click on the Compare button for your feature branch
1. Select the base and compare branches, if necessary. This will be main and my-new-feature, respectively.

### Make the pull request

If everything looks good, you are ready to make a pull request. This is how you let the maintainers
of the python-project-generator project know you have code ready to be reviewed. To submit the pull request:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
1. Click on the Pull Request button for your feature branch
1. You can then click on Commits and Files Changed to make sure everything looks okay one last time
1. Write a description of your changes in the Conversation tab
1. Click Send Pull Request

This request then goes to the repository maintainers, and they will review the code.

### Updating your pull request

Changes to your code may be needed based on the review of your pull request. If this is the case you
can make them in your branch, add a new commit to that branch, push it to GitHub, and the pull
request will be automatically updated. Pushing them to GitHub again is done by:

```sh
git push origin my-new-feature
```

This will automatically update your pull request with the latest code and restart the Continuous
Integration tests.

Another reason you might need to update your pull request is to solve conflicts with changes that
have been merged into the main branch since you opened your pull request.

To do this, you need to rebase your branch:

```sh
git checkout my-new-feature
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

There may be some merge conflicts that need to be resolved. After the feature branch has been update
locally, you can now update your pull request by pushing to the branch on GitHub:

```sh
git push origin my-new-feature
```

If you rebased and get an error when pushing your changes you can resolve it with:

```sh
git push origin my-new-feature --force
```

## Delete your merged branch (optional)

Once your feature branch is accepted into upstream, you’ll probably want to get rid of the branch.
First, merge upstream main into your main branch so git knows it is safe to delete your branch:

```sh
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

Then you can do:

```sh
git branch -d my-new-feature
```

Make sure you use a lower-case -d, or else git won’t warn you if your feature branch has not
actually been merged.

The branch will still exist on GitHub, so to delete it there do:

```sh
git push origin --delete my-new-feature
```
